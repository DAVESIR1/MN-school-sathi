    1.  **EduTech Pro:** Standard professional blue/white theme.
    2.  **Vibrant Burst:** Mesh gradient backgrounds with colorful typography.
    3.  **Neon OLED:** Pure black (`#000000`) background for AMOLED screens.

### 🌑 Neon OLED Theme Polish

- **High Contrast:** Fixed visibility issues in "Expanded Rows" and "Profile Viewer".
- **Neon Accents:** Applied Neon Green/Cyan highlights to headers and active states.
- **Smart Scoping:** Ensured "Classic" profile template becomes Black in Neon mode, while preserving "Rainbow/Nature" colored templates.

### 🖼️ Branding & Sidebar

- **Sidebar Contrast:** Enhanced accessibility with clean text and glow effects.
- **Layout:** Fixed bottom button alignment and removed white box artifacts.

## 🌙 Late Night Updates (Feb 15, 2026)

### 🔐 Access Control Refined

- **HOI Restriction:** Explicitly blocked **HOI Menu** (Staff Info, Diary) for teachers.
- **Firestore Rules:** Added `corrections` collection permissions for future student edit features.

### ✨ Student UX Polish

- **Focused Profile:**
    -   Hidden "Standard/Student" dropdowns when viewing single student.

**Backup Strategy:**

User Data → LocalStorage + IndexedDB (immediate)
